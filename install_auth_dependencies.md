# Install Authentication Dependencies

Run this command to install the required dependencies for authentication:

```bash
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

Or if you're using Expo:

```bash
npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

This package is used to store user authentication data locally on the device.
